# MC-Crossbow-Script

You may have to download AutoHotKey in order to get this to work, haven't tested without. https://www.autohotkey.com/
Just click on the script to run it, then load your crossbows in your inventory and press G to shoot.
to disable, right click the green "H" on the right of your taskbar, then click "exit".
You will not be able to type "G" while script is running.
Use this for fun, not for breaking rules on other servers.
Make sure that this is okay with the server rules before you use it on a server.
